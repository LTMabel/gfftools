This repository contains Perl scripts for working with GFF
annotation files, including operations like sorting, merging and
intersection.

The scripts are hacky, unmaintained, and yet (presumably) largely
bug-free as they have been in production use at the Sanger Institute,
UC Berkeley and other locations since circa 1998.
